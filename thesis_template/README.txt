The thesis.pdf is whole thesis template so far. I have kept some of the chapter as it was at the begining.
These contents are not related to our work, but later I would like to refer how these contents are written 
in latex. What I learned so far is in chapte2 Related Work. 

Please look at from 2.3 to 2.5 to refer BLAS and LAPACK, and how to compile CBLAS.
