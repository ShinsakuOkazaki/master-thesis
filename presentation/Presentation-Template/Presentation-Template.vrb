\begin{itemize}
        \item Use normal reference rather than Reference Counting whenever it is possible.
        \item Trade-off between \blueb{runtime performance} and \blueb{lifetime tracking}.
        \item \blueb{Avoid using Arc} when we can use reference.
        \item Use Arc instead of deep-copy, when \blueb{complexity of objects is large}.
        \item Use deep-copy, when \blueb{complexity of objects is small}, like String.
    \end{itemize}
