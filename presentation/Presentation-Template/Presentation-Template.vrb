\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
        \item There are \blue{not notable differences} among times to access memory with different memory management strategies.
        \item When we drop complex objects constructed with Reference Counting, \blue{additional computation for counting reference results in huge overhead}.
        \item \blue{Sharing set of data with Arc is more expensive than reference.}
        \item \blue{Deep-copying complex objects is more expensive than sharing them with Arc.}
        \item \blue{Sharing Strings with Arc is faster than deep-copying them.}
    \end{itemize}
