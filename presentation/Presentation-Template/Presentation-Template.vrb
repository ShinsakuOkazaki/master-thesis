\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
        \item We have seen that impact of memory memory Management is very large,
              Specially when working on High Complex Object structures and Large Volume of Data Set.

        \item Using a System Language like Rust is very promising to avoid using large CPU computation for memory management.
        \item By using Rust, writing memory-safe code in multithreading is fairly easy.

    \end{itemize}
